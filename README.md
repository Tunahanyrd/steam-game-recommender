## 📌 Dataset
The complete dataset and model are hosted on Hugging Face:
👉 **[Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tunahanyrd/steam-game-recommendation)**

## 📌 How to Use
1. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app/local_app.py
```
2. Download the `.h5` file from Hugging Face and load the model:
```python
import pandas as pd

with pd.HDFStore("game_recommendation.h5", "r") as store:
    df = store["df"]
    similarity_matrix = store["similarity_matrix"].values
```
